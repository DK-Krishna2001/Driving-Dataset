Driving-datasets:

The following links are Google drive links containing datasets of images recorded from a car dashcam with labeled steering angles. Some of the datasets may have timestamps as well.


IMPORTANT:

Absolutely, under NO circumstance, should one ever pilot a car using computer vision software trained on these datasets (or any home made software for that matter). It is extremely dangerous to use your own self-driving software in a car, even if you think you know what you're doing, not to mention it is quite illegal in most places and any accidents will land you in huge lawsuits.


Dataset:

Approximately 45,500 images, 2.2GB. One of the original datasets I made in 2017. Data was recorded around Rancho Palos Verdes and San Pedro California.[Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ue4XohCOV5YXy57S_5tDfCVqzLr101M7/view)
